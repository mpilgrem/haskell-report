-- Module : Data.Word
-- Description: Unsigned integral types
--
-- This module provides unsigned integer types of unspecified width ('Word') and
-- fixed widths ('Word8', 'Word16', 'Word32' and 'Word64'). All arithmetic is
-- performed modulo 2^n, where n is the number of bits in the type.
--
-- For coercing between any two integer types, use 'fromIntegral'. Coercing word
-- types to and from integer types preserves representation, not sign.
--
-- The rules that hold for 'Enum' instances over a bounded type such as 'Int'
-- (see the section of the Haskell language report dealing with arithmetic
-- sequences) also hold for the 'Enum' instances over the various 'Word' types
-- defined here.
--
-- Right and left shifts by amounts greater than or equal to the width of the
-- type result in a zero result. This is contrary to the behaviour in C, which
-- is undefined; a common interpretation is to truncate the shift count to the
-- width of the type, for example 1 << 32 == 1 in some C implementations.
